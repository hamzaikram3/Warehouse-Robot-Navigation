# Warehouse-Robot-Navigation
This project simulates a robot navigating through a warehouse using the A pathfinding algorithm*. The robot finds the shortest path from a start point to a destination while avoiding obstacles.

Features
A Pathfinding*: Finds the shortest path based on the Manhattan distance heuristic.
Interactive Grid: User defines the grid size and places obstacles.
Path Visualization: Displays the robot's path (R), obstacles (#), and empty spaces (.).
